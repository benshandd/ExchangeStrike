# Exchange Strike

ExchangeStrike is a fast-paced 2D arcade-style game, in which you play as a stockbroker that dodges the limitless crypto tokens falling from the sky. 

## Description

The aim of the game is to get the best return/score percentage possible, you can do this by only collecting the green outlined tokens which can give you between 1-15% return. 

When you collect a red outlined token it gives you -100% but you have 3 lives, so, for example, if your score is 250% and you hit two reds, you're left with 50% and 1 life left. But if you hit a red before you get to more than 100% you instantly lose. It gets increasingly faster as you progress so it can be very challenging to complete the game.
